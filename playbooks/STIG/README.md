## Introduction
Security Technical Implementation Guide, which is released by The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is a document that provides guidance on configuring a system to meet cybersecurity requirements for deployment within the Department of Defense (DoD) IT network systems. 
The published STIG guidelines have been included in the scap-security-guide package available under ol8_appstream channel, which can be used with the openscap tool for evaluating the compliance of an Oracle Linux installation.
Individual rules and the remediation details are well documented in [ssg-ol8-guide-standard](https://static.open-scap.org/ssg-guides/ssg-ol8-guide-standard.html).
RPM Package scap-security-guide provides the remediation playbooks for different profiles including STIG which is located under /usr/share/scap-security-guide/ansible/ .

### Details about the playbooks
- openscap.yml - Installs the openscap rpm. Runs the scan against the STIG profile and saves the report at /var/www/html/ssg-results.html
- ol8-playbook-stig.yml - Applies the remediation for STIG profile to the specified set of hosts. 

## Considerations
As part of the remediation activtity, there could be many modifications made to the target host. Hence, kindly review each task before proceeding.
Here are the examples, to list a few:

- DISA-STIG-OL08-00-010550 - Disables SSH root login. SSH session to the servers might give an "Access Denied" error.
- DISA-STIG-OL08-00-010020 - Enables FIPS. Ensure to reboot the host for the FIPS to be enabled. Else, though the remediation is applied, the rule will still be marked as failed.
- DISA-STIG-OL08-00-010670 - Disables kdump services.
